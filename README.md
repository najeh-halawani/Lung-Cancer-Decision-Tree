# Lung Cancer-Decision Tree

The lung cancer dataset is crucial for identifying patterns and developing models that can predict the risk of lung cancer in individuals.
The dataset is based on various features such as smoking habits, age, and symptoms such as yellow fingers, anxiety, and fatigue. By analyzing the dataset, researchers can gain insight into the risk factors that lead to lung cancer and develop models that can identify individuals at high risk for the disease.
This can help in the development of preventive measures and personalized treatment options.
